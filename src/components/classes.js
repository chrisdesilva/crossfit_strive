          <h3>CrossFit</h3>
          <p>CrossFit consists of constantly varied, functional movements performed at high intensities.  Each WOD (Workout of the Day) is designed to improve body composition by burning fat and building muscle.  Our coaches will guide you through weight training and/or cardio exercises. The best thing about CrossFit is that anyone can do it! Every workout can be safely scaled for beginning, intermediate, and advanced athletes.</p>

          <p>Our Pump & Burn classes are a great alternative or supplement to CrossFit.  Each is a 30-minute class, scheduled back-to-back so that you can come to one or both.<br/><br/>
